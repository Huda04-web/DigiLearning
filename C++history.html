<h3>C++ history</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;History of C++ language is interesting to know. Here we are going to discuss brief history of C++ language.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;C++ programming language was developed in 1980 by Bjarne Stroustrup at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph), located in U.S.A.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Bjarne Stroustrup is known as the founder of C++ language.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Cpp History 1
It was develop for adding a feature of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in C without significantly changing the C component.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;C++ programming is "relative" (called a superset) of C, it means any valid C program is also a valid C++ program.</p>

C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[10] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[10] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[11]</p>
<p>C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20).[12] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization.[13] Since 2012, C++ is on a three-year release schedule,[14] with C++23 the next planned standard.[15]</p>
<p>In 1980, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++.[16] The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features.[17] C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.
